# Introduction to Python

John McLevey<br>  
University of Waterloo

This is an **optional** course/workshop module on introductory Python. It is based on Chapter from McLevey (2022) _[Doing Computational Social Science](https://www.johnmclevey.com/publications/books/Doing-Computational-Social-Science.html)_, and was initially prepared for my [Introduction to Computational Social Science](https://github.com/mclevey/computational-social-science) course in the 2024 GESIS Fall Seminar. You can access the other repositories for the course via [gesis24csspy](https://github.com/gesis24csspy).
